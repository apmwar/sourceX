# Welcome to sourceX!

spurceX is the one-stop shop solution for all students and teachers. It strives to create the foundation for a web-based framework which enhances the interactions amongst the members of classroom, amplifies productivity, and also streamlines the entire communication process more efficiently.

sourceX is a stand-alone application to create data, as well as deploy content, onto web pages. It is client-centered and facilitates client control to host files and documents.

### _The 'X' in sourceX stands for_ anything. _We hope to expand sourceX to include other demographics and domains, not just students and teachers._

# Technologies used

As such, the web application employs easy-to-use, inexpensive, cloud-based tools and services, such as Google Drive and GitHub to host the files. In order to use many of these services together, the web application was purpose-built using the server-side development framework, PHP, in conjunction with the database system, phpMyAdmin. Apart from these, the websites were designed and developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
